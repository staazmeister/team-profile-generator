# Team Profile Generator
Week 10 Homework
This week's project was to build a command-line application that generates a Team Profile html file utilizing the node index.js command. This app will take in user's input for each team member and display summary cards for each member. In addition to creating the Team Profile app, we will also utilize unit tests for our code. With each test we will demonstrate receiving a "PASS" score when our code is tested.  

# Installation
1. Copy the clone link of the repository from GitHub
2. Open Bash or Terminal Window
3. When the console opens, navigate to the directory the repository will be added to
4. In the console, type the command "git clone" and paste the link to repository
5. Open repository in preferred code editor
6. Open terminal in code editor
7. Type in terminal "npm init -y" to install dependency packages needed

  Ensure the following packages are installed
- Inquirer (If not inlcuded, you can install by typing "npm install inquirer" in the terminal)
- Jest (If not inlcuded, you can install by typing "npm install jest" in the terminal)



# Usage
1. The user will navigate to index.js file in terminal
2. The user will type "node index.js" to initiate the application and prompts for the user to complete
3. Once the user has answered all prompts, the index.html file will be generated in the "dist" folder

THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

```
